    <h1>Lila Jean Vintage</h1>

    <p>Lila Jean Vintage explores vintage and nostalgia within Australia. Born from a desire to leave something more
      meaningful behind than a Facebook page, the magazine reminds us that the past is important and regret is created
      when we don't ask the questions when we have the chance.</p>

    <p>I have worked extensively in digital communications and as a freelance writer. My days began and ended with
      social
      media - the irony is not lost on me - but after one too many social media conferences it dawned on me that if I
      disappeared tomorrow all that I would leave behind would be a Facebook account and a lot of vintage clothes.
      Through
      the course of modern technology letters gave way to email and printed photographs were deemed obsolete through
      digital. What will the world have to remember me by when I'm gone - an external hard drive?</p>

    <p>Named after my Nan, a woman ahead of her time in so many ways and with whom I was incredibly close, Lila Jean
      hopes
      to encourage people to see beyond themselves. Life is so much more than the next 'selfie' and society has come a
      long way since the 1920s. All I have of my Nan now is some photographs and old letters, which I treasure, and my
      memories. I was only 15 when she passed and it is only now that I can see the influence she has had in my
      life.</p>

    <p>
      Lila Jean spans from the 1920s to the 1970s and even the 1980s (which people debate is not technically 'vintage'
      but
      'retro' but no one can deny it's a fun decade!) and we explore the fashion and style that made these eras so
      sensational. We also look at architecture, films, literature, food, personal anecdotes, family photographs and so
      much more! Sometimes a little bit pin-up, a touch rockabilly, undeniable sentimental and driven by the desire to
      preserve your stories, Lila Jean is, at it's heart, all about vintage in all it's incarnations.</p>

    <p>We believe that everyone has a story and we aim to highlight those stories that your mother, brother,
      grandmother,
      best friend told you that made you laugh, made you cry or just made you see the world a little differently.
      Through
      regular call outs for submissions we aim to capture these memories and give them a permanent home for others to
      enjoy.</p>

    <p>Make sure you follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & Pinterest or feel free to drop me an email at
      editor@lilajeanvintage.com or if you're feeling really nostalgic why not drop me a note at PO Box 505, Winston
      Hills, NSW, 2153. I promise to write back - on actual paper!</p>

    <p>So welcome to Lila Jean, we hope you enjoy the ride.</p>
